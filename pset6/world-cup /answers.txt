Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: None of my predictions proved wrong when i increased the number of simulations in a run.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After running 300 simulations, I observed that the results were consistent for the winning team. Specifically, the same team consistently emerged as the winner in these simulations.
