        <h1>The Space Shuttle program</h1>
        <img src="space_shuttle_logo.jpg" alt="Space Shuttle Logo" class="img-fluid">

        <p>The Space Shuttle program was a groundbreaking era in space exploration that revolutionized how humans access and operate in space. Developed by NASA, the Space Shuttle fleet comprised orbiters, solid rocket boosters, and an external tank. Launching in 1981, the shuttles enabled reusable spacecraft, merging space travel with aircraft-like operations.</p>
        <p>Shuttles like Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour facilitated numerous historic missions. They deployed satellites, conducted scientific research, assembled the International Space Station (ISS), and repaired Hubble Space Telescope. The shuttles also carried astronauts from diverse backgrounds, expanding human presence in space.</p>

        <h2>Key Missions</h2>
        <p>The Space Shuttle program encompassed vital missions that transformed space exploration. STS-1's successful 1981 launch marked the era of reusable spacecraft. STS-7 carried the first American woman, Sally Ride, to space in 1983. STS-41D deployed satellites and STS-31 repaired Hubble in 1990. STS-88 initiated ISS assembly in 1998. Tragedy struck with Challenger (STS-51-L) in 1986 and Columbia (STS-107) in 2003, leading to safety enhancements. The program's culmination was STS-135 in 2011. These missions facilitated satellite deployment, scientific research, international collaboration, and the foundation for future space travel, leaving an indelible impact on human spaceflight history.</p>
