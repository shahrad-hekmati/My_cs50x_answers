        <img src="james-webb-logo.png" alt="James Webb Space Telescope Logo" class="img-fluid mission-image">
        <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a revolutionary space observatory set to launch into orbit to study the universe in unprecedented detail. It is a collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), named after NASA's second administrator, James E. Webb.</p>

    <p>JWST's advanced technologies and large primary mirror will allow it to observe the universe in infrared wavelengths, revealing hidden phenomena such as distant galaxies, forming stars, and even potential signatures of life on exoplanets. With its capabilities, JWST aims to answer fundamental questions about the cosmos and provide insights into the origins of galaxies, stars, and planetary systems.</p>

    <p>The telescope is equipped with cutting-edge instruments that will enable scientists to explore various aspects of the universe, from the formation of the first galaxies to the study of planetary systems and the search for habitable environments. JWST is poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the universe and shape the future of astronomy for decades to come.</p>

            <h2>Preparation and Launch</h2>
            <p>The preparation and launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) represents a monumental feat of engineering and coordination. The telescope's journey began with meticulous planning, design, and construction involving NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Its intricate components were meticulously assembled and tested to withstand the harsh conditions of space.</p>
            <p>The JWST was transported to its launch site at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, where it was integrated with the Ariane 5 rocket. This intricate process required precision and attention to detail to ensure a successful launch. Finally, on December 25, 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope embarked on its remarkable journey into space, poised to revolutionize our understanding of the universe.</p>
